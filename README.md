# CleanRLHF

This is an experimental repository for me to learn more about Transformers, GPT, and RLHF. There is no RLHF in this repository yet.

## Get Started

```
poetry install
poetry run pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda11_cudnn82]==0.4.8" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```


## Roadmap 

- [ ] use dataset in https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-gpt
- [ ] refactor `train_sort`
- [ ] support multi-GPUs
